# Definition

## DatAIq Is a ressource recommendation system for people who wants to learn or upskill and keep up with Data analytics, Data Science, ML and AI

## the problem

Finding resources and roadmaps that match ones needs to get into data or to keep up is a nightmare every gives their own recommendation and they're so many different list.

Inspired by Luke Barousse the creator of Datanerd.tech the go to website now to look for what skills are required for each role and how much they pay, come the idea to create a system that recommends ressources to learn based on Roles, Level and interest for the DATA/AI profesionals and enthusiats.

## the propose solution

the idea is to:

1- create a list of resources by category:

* courses
* bootcamps
* book
* blog
* youtube channels
* discord community
* between free and for money for people to just come put what they're looking for and find recommendation base on a series of features we do not have down yet haha

 2- connect to api that allows us to update when great ressources are release

 3- keep improve it

## how is it different

sites like udemy, coursera, and others recommend resources you can find in them, cousera does recommend youtube channels or even videos, or udemy courses it is the sames for others.

## how are we gonna evaluate the quality

popularity, reviews, will be a factor but we will need more features that we will define later to rank

## how do we access them

we will have to use different APIs and info from the web and build a ranking system that provide great recommendations for our users
